I Got the Email on Thursday, May 5, 2022, 8:48pm about the coding assessment.

I started doing it on Friday May 6, 2022. I started designing the model for the app eventually, I knew I had to make it User friendly, did the authentication process and then started designing the image model

On Saturday May 7 , 2022, started figuring out how to reduce image size according to tiers.

On Tuesday 10, 2022, started handling the errors and also created a view to change plan.  also tried creating an expiry link which 


On wednesday 11, 2022, did vaildation and testcase of the app, and also expiry line which didn't end well.Also had to handle errors due to image url of 400px when it is null.

On Thursday 12, 2022, tried inputing PNG file and was figuring a way to reduce the image size, googled alot of docs but wasn't able to figure it out

On friday 13, Dockerized the app and then did `try and catch` error handling method inorder to avoid the app crashing when someone forgot to input image or even whenone did input a PNG file, so it will return a 400 Bad Request to the user with a message saying `"Please, fill in the required fields and  image should be in jpeg format only"`

On saturday 14, push it for a live preview on heroku
